# TelegramBotAPI Libraries

This project was created due to neccessity of additional libraries over [tgbotapi](https://github.com/InsanusMokrassar/TelegramBotAPI).
Currently there are plans to create several libraries at the start of this project:

* Cache library for media (saving and autorefreshing of `fileId`)
* Cache library for admins (saving chat admins, autoupdate and refreshing by command (maybe))
